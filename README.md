# GoblokJS
GoblokJS is a somehow simple library for reactive UI in Javascript.
"Goblok" is a word in bahasa Indonesia which means "dumb". Why dumb? 
Yes because this framework doesn't follow the current Javascript best 
practices. This is just a simple library that I use to develop my Laravel 
application with blade templating engine.
